#### TALKS:

Welcome and a brief update on OWASP Projects & Events from the OWASP Birmingham UK Chapter Leaders.

-   **“The Rise of Cryptocurrency Exploits and Facebook’s Libra” - Vladlena Benson** 

With Facebook plans to launch its cryptocurrency Libra, Vladena asks, should we be concerned? Does the data usage of Facebook users
jeopardise the anonymity of cryptocurrency payments? Will the involvement of a number of data giants/monopolies further take the
data ownership away from users? Can regulation stay up to speed with cryptocurrencies? Can the security of cryptocurrencies which rely
on existing algorithms remain secure when constantly challenged by cyber attackers?

-   **“Advances in modern Attack Bots” - David Warburton** ([PDF](assets/slides/OWASPLondon_20190718_AdvancedBots_warburtr0n.pdf "wikilink"))

Bots are generally seen as a bit of a nuisance and widely regarded as the weapon of choice for DDoS attacks. However, modern bots are capable of much more and are claimed to be behind three quarters of all attacks that hit web sites and APIs. Techniques such as rate limiting, IP blacklisting and even CAPTCHAs often do little to prevent the attacks as they evolve, evading controls which try to differentiate between bots and humans. In this session we’re going to look at what bots are and how they’re created, what they’re now capable of, which industries are most affected by them and how they are evolving to avoid our current defences.
